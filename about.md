## PRINCIPAL'S DESK
I have  great pleasure to present before you this fourth issue of e-magazine designed by our students who are brand ambassadors of our Wadian culture.

‘YOUTHSPECTRUM’ is a platform for the expression of the youthful spirit of the staff and students. Our students are not only interested in science and technology but they are equally well versed in creative arts. They are creative, enthusiasticand innovative and this vibrant mood is beautifully captured in the various sections of the e-magazine.

I congratulate the dynamic team of E-magazine for bringing out yet another issue in time.

We believe in changing with the changing times, the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.The strongest light is the light that shines within you….Youth Spectrum has tried to capture this light in our students


I am sure the thoughts and feelings reflected in the articles will enrich, ennoble and uplift us to a higher plane of thoughts .I extend my best wishes for the success of this  E-magazine.
