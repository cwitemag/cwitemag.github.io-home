It gives me great pleasure to write a few words on the occasion of launching E-Magazine of our institute named ‘Youth Spectrum’. Youth is a symbol of energy, novelty, creativity and enthusiasm. To spread these qualitative colours of Cusrow Wadian Youth, we are happy to launch this magazine on the auspicious occasion that is ‘Gudi Padwa’.
​
I congratulate team members of E-Magazine for their blistering attempt of completing the task of E-Magazine very effectively. I also congratulate students for their active participation and contribution in this magazine. I am sure that ‘Youth Spectrum’ will be a stepping stone for our students to venture in the future in various fields of arts like photography, poetry, writing, sketching, painting and so on. It will certainly open a new vista for our students in their career as well as life. I remember a great poet Rabindranath Tagore saying “One cannot cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water”. Similarly, our students and team members of E- Magazine have ventured by developing such a beautiful, thought provoking and entertaining E-Magazine. They have certainly done a good job. I extend my best wishes for this E-Magazine.
